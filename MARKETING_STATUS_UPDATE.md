### 🎤 **Podcast/Interview Talking Points**

**Problem Statement:**
"Every developer has dealt with messy data - whether it's inconsistent API responses, scraped web content, or legacy system exports. Traditional parsers break when formats change, and writing custom solutions is time-consuming and brittle."

**Solution Innovation:**
"Parserator uses a two-stage approach: first, an 'Architect' LLM analyzes your desired output and creates a detailed extraction plan using just a small sample. Then an 'Extractor' LLM executes that plan on your full dataset. This gives you the accuracy of careful planning with the efficiency of direct execution."

**EMA Philosophy:**
"We built Parserator on Exoditical Moral Architecture principles because we believe the ultimate expression of empowerment is the freedom to leave. Your data belongs to you, you should be able to export everything, and you should compete on merit, not vendor lock-in."
