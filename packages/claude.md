# Packages Directory - Claude Guidelines

## Overview
The `/packages/` directory contains the core Parserator modules in a monorepo structure. Each package has specific responsibilities and deployment targets.

## Package Status (Current)

### âœ… Production Ready & Verified Working
- **`sdk-node/`** - âœ… Published on NPM as `parserator-sdk` v1.0.0 (tested and working)
- **`api/`** - âœ… Firebase Cloud Functions working perfectly (95% confidence, ~500 tokens)
- **`sdk-python/`** - âœ… Built and ready for PyPI (v1.1.0-alpha with dist files)
- **`core/`** - âœ… Core parsing engine working (powers the API)

### ðŸ”§ Status Verified
- **`mcp-adapter/`** - Directory exists, needs individual package verification
- **`dashboard/`** - Next.js dashboard with built output files ready
- **`adk/`** - Agent Development Kit integration directory
- **`email-parser/`** - Specialized email parsing package

## Development Guidelines

### Package Structure Standards
Each package should have:
- `package.json` with proper metadata
- `README.md` with usage examples
- TypeScript configuration for type safety
- Jest tests with realistic data
- Proper build/deployment scripts

### Inter-Package Dependencies
- **Core** provides the parsing engine
- **API** uses Core for Firebase functions
- **SDKs** call the API endpoints
- **Dashboard** provides web UI
- **MCP Adapter** enables agent integration

### Build System Issues
- **Turbo**: Monorepo manager has Linux binary issues
- **Workaround**: Build packages individually
- **TypeScript**: Some packages have compilation errors

### Testing Standards
- Use realistic parsing examples
- Test error handling thoroughly
- Validate EMA compliance features
- Include performance benchmarks

## Critical Fixes Needed

### API Package (`packages/api/`) âœ… WORKING
- âœ… Endpoint working perfectly: `/v1/parse` returns proper JSON
- âœ… Firebase deployment complete and functional
- âœ… CORS configuration working (supports cross-origin requests)
- âœ… Two-stage Architect-Extractor pattern operational

### Core Package (`packages/core/`) âœ… WORKING  
- âœ… Core parsing engine functional (powers the API)
- âœ… Two-stage processing implemented correctly
- Note: Individual build may have issues in WSL, but production deployment works

### Node SDK (`packages/sdk-node/`) âœ… VERIFIED
- âœ… Published and tested: `parserator-sdk` v1.0.0 on NPM
- âœ… Loads successfully in Node.js environments
- âœ… Ready for immediate use by developers

### Python SDK (`packages/sdk-python/`) âœ… READY
- âœ… Built successfully: v1.1.0-alpha with .whl and .tar.gz files
- âœ… Complete package structure with examples and docs
- âœ… Ready for PyPI publication

## Deployment Process

### Individual Package Deployment
```bash
# For each package:
cd packages/[package-name]
npm run build
npm test
npm publish  # if applicable
```

### Firebase API Deployment
```bash
cd packages/api
firebase deploy --only functions
```

### Python Package Deployment
```bash
cd packages/sdk-python
python -m build
twine upload dist/*
```

## EMA Compliance
All packages must include:
- Data export capabilities
- Migration tools
- No vendor lock-in features
- Clear licensing (MIT)
- User data sovereignty

## Remember
- Each package should work independently
- Maintain consistent API interfaces
- Document all breaking changes
- Test in production-like environments
