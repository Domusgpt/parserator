# üö® CRITICAL: PROMPT REGRESSION DETECTED

## WHAT WE FOUND VS WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE

### ‚ùå CURRENT BROKEN PROMPTS (Regression):

**Architect Prompt (Basic Stub):**
```typescript
`You are the Architect in a two-stage parsing system. Create a detailed SearchPlan for extracting data.

SAMPLE DATA:
${sample}

TARGET SCHEMA:
${JSON.stringify(body.outputSchema, null, 2)}

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Create one step per field in the target schema
- Each step should have:
  - field: the field name from the schema
  - instruction: specific extraction instruction
  - pattern: regex or search pattern to find the data
  - validation: expected data type
- Set confidence between 0.8-0.95 based on data clarity
- Choose strategy: "field-by-field extraction", "pattern matching", "semantic parsing", etc.
- Be precise and actionable

Create a comprehensive SearchPlan that the Extractor can follow exactly.`
```

**Extractor Prompt (Basic Stub):**
```typescript
`You are the Extractor in a two-stage parsing system. Execute this SearchPlan on the full input data.

SEARCH PLAN:
${JSON.stringify(searchPlan, null, 2)}

FULL INPUT DATA:
${sanitizedInputData}

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Follow the SearchPlan exactly as specified by the Architect
- Extract data for each field using the provided instructions and patterns
- If a field cannot be found, use null
- Be precise and accurate
- Return data in the exact format specified by the target schema

TARGET OUTPUT FORMAT:
${JSON.stringify(body.outputSchema, null, 2)}

Execute the plan and return the extracted data.`
```

### ‚úÖ WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE (Based on Documentation):

According to HANDOFF-PROMPT.md, we should have:
- **95% accuracy** system
- **EMA-compliant** architecture
- **Error recovery with retry logic**
- **Schema simplification**
- **Structured outputs that eliminate core parsing errors**
- **70% token reduction**

### üîç MISSING SOPHISTICATED FEATURES:

1. **Error Recovery Instructions** - The prompts should include retry logic
2. **EMA Principles** - Should include data sovereignty and ethical guidance  
3. **Schema Simplification** - Prompts should know how to simplify when failing
4. **Context Awareness** - Should understand user intent and provide helpful errors
5. **95% Accuracy Techniques** - Missing advanced parsing strategies
6. **Token Optimization** - No mention of efficient processing

### üí° RECONSTRUCTION NEEDED:

The prompts need to be rebuilt to include:

**Enhanced Architect Prompt Should Include:**
```typescript
// EMA-compliant data sovereignty principles
// Error recovery planning ("if this fails, try this")
// Schema simplification strategies
// Token optimization techniques
// 95% accuracy methodologies
// User context understanding
// Intelligent error explanation capabilities
```

**Enhanced Extractor Prompt Should Include:**
```typescript
// Robust error handling ("if field not found, explain why")
// Data sovereignty compliance
// Context-aware error messages for users
// Automatic retry with simplified approaches
// 95% accuracy validation techniques
```

## üö® IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:

1. **Restore sophisticated prompts** with all missing features
2. **Add EMA compliance** to parsing instructions
3. **Implement error recovery** within the prompts themselves
4. **Add your AI error handling vision** - contextual explanations
5. **Optimize for 95% accuracy** and token efficiency

## üéØ YOUR VISION INTEGRATION:

You wanted "error handling as formatted response by the LLM system with less code and more architect role using same context" - this is EXACTLY what the sophisticated prompts should do!

The Architect should be able to:
- Generate helpful error explanations using the same context
- Suggest fixes in natural language
- Provide contextual guidance to users
- Handle errors intelligently within the parsing flow

**This regression explains why we're not seeing the sophisticated behavior mentioned in the documentation!**
