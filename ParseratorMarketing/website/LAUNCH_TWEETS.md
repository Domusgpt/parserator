🚀 LAUNCHING: Parserator - The parsing engine that actually works

95% accuracy, 70% fewer tokens, handles ANY messy data format

Your application code never changes. Ever.

Live API: https://app-5108296280.us-central1.run.app

🧵 Thread on how it works ⬇️

Problem: APIs change formats constantly

❌ Your app: Breaks
❌ You: Write custom parsers  
❌ Result: Technical debt hell

✅ Parserator: Adapts automatically
✅ You: Ship features instead
✅ Result: Happy developers

How it works (Architect-Extractor pattern):

🏗️ Stage 1: AI Architect plans parsing on small sample (cheap)
⚡ Stage 2: AI Extractor executes plan on full data (fast)

Result: Smarter than single-LLM, 70% fewer tokens

**Tweet 4:**
Built on Exoditical Moral Architecture:

📤 Your data belongs to YOU
🔓 No vendor lock-in, ever
🌉 Bridge between any systems
🆓 The ultimate freedom is the freedom to leave

We compete on merit, not walls.

## LinkedIn Post

🚀 After months of development, I'm excited to launch Parserator - the parsing engine built for the real world.

The problem: Every API, CSV, email, and user input has a different format. Your application code becomes a graveyard of edge cases.

The solution: A two-stage AI system that plans parsing on samples, then executes on full data. 95% accuracy, 70% fewer tokens than traditional approaches.

But this isn't just about parsing. It's about digital sovereignty - your data belongs to you, not trapped in proprietary formats.

**Comment to add:**
Happy to answer questions about the Architect-Extractor pattern or the EMA philosophy behind it. The key insight was separating "planning" from "execution" to optimize token usage while improving accuracy.
