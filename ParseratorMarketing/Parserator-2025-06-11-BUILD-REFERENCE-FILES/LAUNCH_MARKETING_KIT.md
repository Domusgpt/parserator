## 🎯 LAUNCH TWEET THREAD

### Tweet 1 (Main Announcement)
```
🚀 LAUNCHING: Parserator - The AI parsing engine that just changed everything

Instead of sending ALL your data to ONE model (expensive + slow), we use:

🧠 "Architect" LLM: Creates parsing plan from tiny sample (pennies)
⚡ "Extractor" LLM: Executes plan on full data (lightning fast)

Result: 70% LESS tokens, 95%+ accuracy

🧵 1/7
```

### Tweet 2 (Problem/Solution)
```
📝 THE PROBLEM: 

Traditional parsing:
❌ Send 100KB text + complex instructions to GPT-4
❌ Costs $2-5 per document  
❌ Takes 10-30 seconds
❌ Often hallucinates on large docs

💡 OUR SOLUTION:
✅ Two-stage "Architect-Extractor" pattern
✅ 70% token reduction
✅ Sub-3-second processing
✅ Production-grade accuracy

2/7
```

### Tweet 3 (Technical Innovation)
```
🔬 THE ARCHITECT-EXTRACTOR PATTERN:

Stage 1 "Architect" (Gemini Flash):
• Input: Schema + 1KB sample
• Output: Detailed SearchPlan
• Cost: ~$0.01

Stage 2 "Extractor" (Gemini Flash): 
• Input: Full data + SearchPlan
• Output: Clean JSON
• Cost: ~$0.10

Total: 70% cheaper than single-LLM approaches! 

3/7
```

### Tweet 4 (Use Cases)
```
🎯 PERFECT FOR:

📧 Email → Contact cards
🧾 Invoices → Accounting data  
📄 PDFs → Structured exports
🗂️ CRM cleanup → Normalized records
📊 Research → Data tables
🔗 API responses → Clean objects

Basically: ANY messy data → Beautiful JSON

Works on documents from 100 chars to 100KB!

```

### Tweet 5 (Developer Experience)
```
👨‍💻 DEVELOPER EXPERIENCE:

Node.js SDK:
```javascript
const client = new ParseratorClient({
  apiKey: 'pk_live_...'
});

const result = await client.parse({
  inputData: 'John Smith, john@email.com, (555) 123-4567',
  outputSchema: { name: 'string', email: 'email', phone: 'phone' }
});
```

Chrome Extension: Right-click → Parse
API: Direct HTTP calls

## 📱 LINKEDIN POST

```
🚀 Excited to launch Parserator - a revolutionary approach to AI-powered data parsing!

THE BREAKTHROUGH: Instead of using one expensive LLM call, we use two optimized calls:

1️⃣ "Architect" LLM: Analyzes a small sample and creates a detailed extraction plan
2️⃣ "Extractor" LLM: Executes the plan on the full document

📊 RESULTS:
• 70% reduction in token costs
• 95%+ accuracy on unstructured data  
• Sub-3-second processing times
• Production-ready scalability

🎯 PERFECT FOR:
• Email → Contact extraction
• Invoices → Accounting data
• PDFs → Structured exports  
• Legacy data migration
• CRM cleanup projects

💻 DEVELOPER-READY:
✅ Live API with 99.9% uptime
✅ Node.js SDK with TypeScript support
✅ Chrome extension for one-click parsing
✅ IDE plugins for VS Code & JetBrains
✅ Comprehensive documentation

This solves a real problem I've faced for years - turning messy, unstructured data into clean, usable JSON without breaking the bank on API costs.

Try it: npm install @parserator/node-sdk

What data parsing challenges are you facing? I'd love to hear how this could help!

## 📺 YOUTUBE/DEMO SCRIPT (5-minute video)

### Opening Hook (0-30s)
"What if I told you there's a way to parse unstructured data with 70% fewer tokens while getting better accuracy? I just built something that does exactly that. Let me show you."

### Problem Setup (30s-1m)
"Traditional AI parsing sends everything to one model. Big documents + complex instructions = expensive API calls. Here's a typical invoice parsing request... [screen record] That just cost $3.50 and took 15 seconds."

### Solution Demo (1m-3m)
"My Architect-Extractor pattern works differently. First, the Architect analyzes just a tiny sample... [show API call] Creates a plan for $0.01. Then the Extractor uses that plan... [show second call] Full parsing for $0.15 total. 70% savings!"

### Live Demo (3m-4m)
"Let me parse this messy email in real-time... [screen record of Chrome extension] Right-click, parse, boom. Clean JSON in 2 seconds."

### Call to Action (4m-5m)
"The API is live, SDK is on NPM, Chrome extension is submitting. Links in description. If you're tired of expensive AI parsing, this is your solution."

## 🎪 PRODUCT HUNT LAUNCH

### Tagline
"The AI parsing engine that cuts token costs by 70%"

### Description
```
Parserator revolutionizes data parsing with a breakthrough Architect-Extractor pattern.

Instead of expensive single-LLM calls, we use:

## 📧 EMAIL CAMPAIGN

### Subject Lines (A/B Test)
- "I just cut my AI parsing costs by 70% (here's how)"
- "The parsing breakthrough that changes everything"
- "Stop overpaying for data extraction"

### Email Template
```
Hi [Name],

Quick question: How much are you spending on AI-powered data parsing?

If you're like most developers, probably way too much.

I just solved this with a breakthrough called the "Architect-Extractor" pattern:

• Instead of sending everything to one expensive model...
• I use two optimized calls that cost 70% less
• While achieving 95%+ accuracy

The API is live, SDK is ready, Chrome extension launching.

Want to see it in action? [Demo Link]

Or try it directly: npm install @parserator/node-sdk

Best,
Paul

P.S. I'm giving early adopters free credits. Reply "PARSE" to get yours.
