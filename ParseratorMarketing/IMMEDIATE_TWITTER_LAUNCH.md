🚀 LAUNCHING PARSERATOR - The AI that reads everything

Just spent months building an AI that can turn ANY unstructured data into perfect JSON. Medical records → structured data. Invoices → clean objects. Emails → parsed fields.

Here's what makes it special... 🧵
```

🧠 THE ARCHITECT-EXTRACTOR PATTERN

Most AI parsers throw everything at one model. We use TWO stages:
- Architect: Creates a detailed parsing plan
- Extractor: Executes the plan perfectly

Result: 70% fewer tokens, 95% accuracy
```

📊 REAL TEST RESULTS

We tested 16 complex real-world documents:
✅ Medical lab results
✅ Software licenses  
✅ Hotel reservations
✅ Quality control reports
✅ University transcripts

100% success rate. Every. Single. One.
```

⚡ PERFORMANCE THAT MATTERS

Average processing time: 6.8 seconds
Token usage: ~1,350 per document  
Confidence score: 95% consistent
Fields extracted: 7-11 per document

This isn't a demo. This is production-ready.
```

🛠️ DEVELOPER-FIRST DESIGN

```bash
npm install parserator-sdk

const client = new ParseratorClient();
const result = await client.parse({
  inputData: "messy data here",
  outputSchema: { name: "string", email: "email" }
});
```

5-minute integration. That's it.
```

🏭 HANDLES EVERY INDUSTRY

From healthcare to legal to e-commerce:
- Invoice processing ✅
- Medical records ✅  
- Real estate listings ✅
- Insurance claims ✅
- Academic transcripts ✅

If it's text, we can structure it.
```

💰 PRICING THAT MAKES SENSE

Free: 1,000 requests/month
Pro: $49/month (50,000 requests) 
Enterprise: Custom pricing

Cost per request: $0.001
Manual data entry cost: $0.10+

ROI is obvious.

🎯 THE MAGIC IN ACTION

Input: "Dr. Sarah Johnson <sarah@biotech.com> Phone: (617) 555-0123"

Output: 
```json
{
  "name": "Dr. Sarah Johnson",
  "email": "sarah@biotech.com", 
  "phone": "(617) 555-0123"
}
```

It just works.
