Title: "Built an AI parser that cuts data extraction costs by 70% [Technical Details]"

I was spending way too much on LLM tokens for data extraction, so I built a two-stage parsing system that dramatically reduces costs while improving accuracy.

**The Problem:**
- Single LLM approaches are expensive (sending full data for reasoning)
- Inconsistent results with messy real-world data
- Breaking when data formats change slightly

**My Solution - The Architect-Extractor Pattern:**
1. **Architect LLM**: Creates parsing plan using tiny data sample
2. **Extractor LLM**: Executes plan on full data with laser focus
3. **Result**: 70% token savings, 95%+ accuracy

**Real Example:**
[Include code example showing before/after]

**Results:**
- Token usage: 2,450 ‚Üí 730 (70% reduction)
- Accuracy: 78% ‚Üí 96% (dual validation)
- Cost per parse: $0.12 ‚Üí $0.04

I've wrapped this into an API at parserator.com if anyone wants to try it (free tier available). Happy to answer technical questions!

[Include metrics, code samples, performance comparisons]
```

**Template 2: Tutorial Post**
```
Title: "How to parse ANY data format with AI - Complete tutorial [Python/Node.js]"

After struggling with brittle parsing logic for years, I figured out how to make AI handle any data format intelligently. Here's a complete walkthrough.

**What We're Building:**
A system that can take messy emails, CSVs, PDFs, or any text and extract structured JSON.

**The Technique:**
[Step-by-step tutorial with code examples]

**Why This Works:**
[Technical explanation of dual-stage approach]

**Try It Yourself:**
[Provide working code examples they can run]

Source code: [GitHub link]
Live demo: [Demo link]
```

**Template 3: AMA Style**
```
Title: "I built an AI data parsing SaaS that processes 100K requests/day - AMA"

6 months ago I was manually writing parsers for every data format. Today my startup processes 100K+ parsing requests daily using AI.

**Proof:** [Screenshots of dashboard, metrics]

**What I Learned:**
- Traditional regex/rules-based parsing doesn't scale
- Single LLM approaches are too expensive
- The secret is planning vs execution separation

**Tech Stack:**
- Gemini 1.5 Flash (dual-stage pattern)
- Firebase Functions (serverless scaling)  
- Next.js (developer dashboard)
- TypeScript SDKs

Happy to answer questions about the technical implementation, business model, customer acquisition, or anything else!
