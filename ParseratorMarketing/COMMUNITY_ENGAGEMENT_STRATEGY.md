## Content Strategy by Platform

### **Discord Engagement Framework**

#### **Value-First Approach**
```
1. HELP FIRST (70% of interactions)
   - Answer technical questions in detail
   - Share code examples and solutions
   - Provide debugging assistance
   - Offer performance optimization tips

2. EDUCATE SECOND (20% of interactions)
   - Share technical insights and best practices
   - Explain complex concepts clearly
   - Provide industry analysis and trends
   - Demonstrate thought leadership

3. PROMOTE LAST (10% of interactions)
   - Natural mentions in context of solving problems
   - Share relevant use cases and examples
   - Invite to try solutions for their specific needs
   - Showcase results only when directly relevant
```

#### **Technical Content Templates**

**Problem-Solution Format:**
```
"Working on form validation for user-submitted documents? 

The traditional regex/OCR approach breaks on real-world variations:
‚ùå Invoice formats differ between vendors
‚ùå User handwriting and scanning artifacts  
‚ùå Complex nested data structures
‚ùå Edge cases that aren't in your test data

AI parsing handles these variations gracefully:
‚úÖ 95% accuracy across document types
‚úÖ Handles nested JSON extraction
‚úÖ Smart type conversion (dates, currencies, phones)
‚úÖ Works with messy real-world data

Built a production system that processes 89K docs/month - happy to share implementation details if anyone's working on similar challenges."
```

**Show and Tell Format:**
```
"Just hit a milestone: 95% accuracy on 16 different document types! üéâ

The breakthrough was using a two-stage approach:
1. Architect AI creates extraction plan from sample
2. Extractor AI follows plan for precise data extraction

Results vs single-model approach:
‚Üí 70% fewer tokens (cost reduction)
‚Üí 95% accuracy (vs 87% traditional)
‚Üí 100% success rate on real documents

Technical details: [link to blog post]
Live demo: [API endpoint]

What document parsing challenges are you folks working on?"
```

### **Slack Engagement Framework**

#### **Professional Networking Focus**
```
1. THOUGHT LEADERSHIP (50%)
   - Industry analysis and technical insights
   - Architecture and scaling discussions
   - Business strategy and market positioning
   - EMA principles and ethical development

2. COMMUNITY VALUE (30%)
   - Help others with technical problems
   - Share resources and learning materials
   - Connect people with relevant expertise
   - Provide feedback and advice

3. RELATIONSHIP BUILDING (20%)
   - Participate in discussions actively
   - Follow up on conversations privately
   - Offer collaboration opportunities
   - Share successes and learnings
```

#### **Professional Content Templates**

**Technical Leadership Format:**
```
"Interesting architecture challenge we solved recently:

Problem: Processing 89K documents/month with unpredictable formats
Traditional approach: Single LLM ‚Üí inconsistent results, high costs
Our solution: Two-stage pipeline (Architect ‚Üí Extractor)

Results:
‚Ä¢ 70% token reduction
‚Ä¢ 95% accuracy improvement  
‚Ä¢ 100% success rate on production data
‚Ä¢ $0.001 vs $0.003 cost per document

The key insight: separate planning from execution. Different cognitive modes require different prompting strategies.

Has anyone else experimented with multi-stage LLM pipelines? Curious about other approaches to this problem."
```

**Business Strategy Format:**
```
"Building on EMA (Exoditical Moral Architecture) principles has been our biggest competitive advantage:

Instead of vendor lock-in:
‚úÖ Full data export capabilities
‚úÖ Migration assistance to competitors
‚úÖ Open standards (JSON, OpenAPI)
‚úÖ Transparent pricing

Counter-intuitive result: customers choose to stay BECAUSE they can leave easily.

67% of our growth comes from word-of-mouth. Trust drives business.

Anyone else seeing success with ethics-first positioning? The traditional 'trap customers' model feels increasingly outdated."
