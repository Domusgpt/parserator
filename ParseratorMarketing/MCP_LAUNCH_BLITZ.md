## ðŸ”¥ CONTENT TEMPLATES READY TO DEPLOY

### Hacker News Post
```
Show HN: MCP server for reliable AI agent data parsing (95% accuracy, 70% fewer tokens)

We built an MCP server that exposes our Architect-Extractor parsing pattern to any AI agent. 

Unlike naive "prompt for JSON" approaches, we use a two-stage process:
1. Architect plans the parsing strategy  
2. Extractor executes with surgical precision

Result: 95% accuracy vs ~85% for raw LLM prompting, with 70% fewer tokens.

Works with Claude Desktop, LangChain, CrewAI - any MCP-compatible agent.

npm install -g @parserator/mcp-server

Built on Exoditical Moral Architecture principles - no vendor lock-in, full export capabilities.

Demo: [live examples]
Code: https://github.com/parserator/mcp-server
```

### Reddit r/MachineLearning Post
```
Title: "[D] Built an MCP server for agent data parsing - 95% accuracy, 70% token reduction"

Body: [Technical implementation details, benchmarks, open questions for community]
```

### Dev.to Blog Post
```
Title: "Building Production MCP Servers: Architecture Patterns from Parserator"
