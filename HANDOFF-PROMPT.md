## MISSION: PUBLISH PARSERATOR EXTENSIONS IMMEDIATELY

I need you to help me **publish and deploy** the ready-to-ship Parserator platform extensions. This is a **production-ready system** - do NOT rebuild or redevelop anything.

### CRITICAL CONTEXT - READ THESE FILES FIRST:
1. **`/mnt/c/Users/millz/parserator-launch-ready/***LOOKFIRST***.md`** - Complete handoff briefing
2. **`/mnt/c/Users/millz/parserator-launch-ready/CLAUDE.md`** - Main project context
3. **`/mnt/c/Users/millz/parserator-launch-ready/README.md`** - Current status overview

### WHAT'S ALREADY WORKING:
- âœ… **API**: Live at `https://app-5108296280.us-central1.run.app/v1/parse` (95% confidence, production tested)
- âœ… **MCP Server**: Published on NPM as `parserator-mcp-server@1.0.1`
- âœ… **Node SDK**: Published on NPM as `parserator-sdk@1.0.0`
- âœ… **Website**: Live at `https://parserator-production.web.app`

### IMMEDIATE TASKS - FOCUS ONLY ON PUBLISHING:

1. **Python SDK to PyPI**:
   - Location: `/mnt/c/Users/millz/parserator-launch-ready/python-sdk/dist/`
   - Files ready: `parserator_sdk-1.1.0a0.tar.gz` and `.whl`
   - Action: `twine upload dist/*` (may need PyPI account setup)

2. **Chrome Extension to Chrome Web Store**:
   - Location: `/mnt/c/Users/millz/parserator-launch-ready/chrome-extension/parserator-chrome-extension-v1.0.2.zip`
   - Action: Manual submission to Chrome Web Store developer portal

3. **VS Code Extension to Marketplace**:
   - Location: `/mnt/c/Users/millz/parserator-launch-ready/vscode-extension/parserator-1.0.0.vsix`
   - Action: Manual submission to VS Code Marketplace

4. **Dashboard Deployment**:
   - Location: `/mnt/c/Users/millz/parserator-launch-ready/dashboard/out/`
   - Action: Deploy static files to hosting platform (Netlify/Vercel)

5. **JetBrains Plugin**:
   - Location: `/mnt/c/Users/millz/parserator-launch-ready/jetbrains-plugin/`
   - Status: Complete source code, build environment issues
   - Action: Either fix build or provide manual packaging instructions

### CRITICAL RULES:
- **DO NOT** test or rebuild the API - it's working perfectly
- **DO NOT** modify any built packages - they're production-ready
- **FOCUS ON** publishing existing packages to their respective stores/platforms
- **ASK FOR** any required credentials (PyPI, developer accounts, etc.)
- **PROVIDE** clear step-by-step instructions for manual submissions

### WORKING DIRECTORY:
`/mnt/c/Users/millz/parserator-launch-ready/`

### SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Python SDK live on PyPI
- Chrome extension submitted to store
- VS Code extension submitted to marketplace
- Dashboard deployed and accessible
- Clear instructions for JetBrains plugin

**Start by reading the three context files above, then immediately begin with the Python SDK PyPI upload. Everything is built and ready - just need to publish!**

## Additional Context Notes:

### Project Overview:
Parserator is the world's first EMA-compliant AI parsing platform that converts unstructured text into structured JSON with 95% accuracy. It features a two-stage Architect-Extractor pattern that reduces token usage by 70% while maintaining high accuracy.

### Key Performance Metrics:
- **95% accuracy** (validated through chaos testing)
- **2.6 second** average response time
- **$0.000075** per request cost
- **Universal agent compatibility** (Google ADK, MCP, LangChain, AutoGPT, etc.)

### EMA Principles:
The platform follows Exoditical Moral Architecture principles:
- User data sovereignty
- No vendor lock-in
- Complete data portability  
- Transparent competition
