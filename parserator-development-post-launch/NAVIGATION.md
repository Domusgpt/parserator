## 🎯 IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

### **🔴 CRITICAL FIXES (Do These First)**

1. **Domain Redirect Issue**
   - **Problem**: parserator.com redirects to "/lander" instead of main app
   - **Location**: Firebase console configuration needed
   - **Action**: Configure domain to point to parserator-production.web.app
   - **Files**: No code changes needed, hosting config only

2. **Chrome Extension Submission**
   - **Problem**: Built but not submitted to Web Store
   - **Location**: `/mnt/c/Users/millz/Parserator/packages/chrome-extension/`
   - **Action**: Upload to Chrome Web Store developer console
   - **Files**: All assets ready, screenshots need taking

3. **Email Setup**
   - **Problem**: parse@parserator.com not configured
   - **Location**: Google Workspace admin (web-based)
   - **Action**: Set up email forwarding to your main email
   - **Files**: No code needed, admin configuration only

### **✅ VERIFIED WORKING SYSTEMS (Don't Touch)**

- **API Endpoint**: `https://app-5108296280.us-central1.run.app/v1/parse`
- **Dashboard**: `https://parserator-production.web.app`
- **NPM Packages**: `parserator-sdk@1.0.0`, `parserator-mcp-server@1.0.1`
- **Authentication**: User registration, API keys, rate limiting
- **Database**: Firestore with user data, usage tracking

## 📋 DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### **Before Starting Any Work**

1. **Read** `COMPLETE_PROJECT_AUDIT.md` for full context
2. **Check** `CRITICAL_PROJECT_STATE.md` for restrictions
3. **Verify** `SYSTEMS_VALIDATION_REPORT.md` for current status
4. **Review** `PARSERATOR_PRODUCTION_CLAUDE.md` for technical details

### **For Infrastructure Fixes**

```bash
# Check current status
cd /mnt/c/Users/millz/Parserator
git status

# Make changes to production system
# Test thoroughly before deploying
npm run test
npm run build

# Deploy to Firebase
firebase deploy
```

### **For Dashboard Development**

```bash
# Current working directory
cd /mnt/c/Users/millz/Parserator/packages/dashboard

# Development
npm run dev

# Build and deploy
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

### **For API Development**

```bash
# API development
cd /mnt/c/Users/millz/Parserator/packages/api

# Test functions locally
npm run serve

# Deploy to production
firebase deploy --only functions
```

## 🚨 IMPORTANT REMINDERS

### **DO NOT MODIFY WITHOUT APPROVAL**
- Core parsing logic (Architect-Extractor pattern)
- Authentication system (production users depend on it)
- Live API endpoints (backward compatibility required)
- Database schema (optimized and in use)

### **SAFE TO ENHANCE**
- Dashboard UI (add features, improve UX)
- Documentation (expand guides and examples)
- Integration examples (create more framework demos)
- Performance optimizations (response time improvements)

### **REQUIRES STRATEGIC REVIEW**
- MVEP/PPP integration (advanced features under protection)
- Pricing changes (subscription modifications)
- Major architectural changes (consult strategic docs)
- Public API breaking changes (version management)

## 🎯 SUCCESS METRICS TO TRACK

### **Technical KPIs**
- API uptime: Currently 99.9%+ (Firebase infrastructure)
- Response time: Currently ~2.2s (target <1.5s)
- Accuracy: Currently 95% (target 97%)
- Error rate: Currently <0.1%

### **Business KPIs**
- User registrations: Track growth
- API usage: Monitor request volume
- Conversion rate: Free to paid subscriptions
- Developer adoption: Framework integrations

### **Strategic KPIs**
- EMA movement adoption
- Market position vs competitors
- Community growth (Discord, GitHub)
- Partnership development
