# ðŸ”´ DOMAIN REDIRECT FIX - STEP BY STEP

**Priority**: CRITICAL - Blocks all marketing launch  
**Time Required**: 30 minutes  
**Difficulty**: Easy (configuration only, no coding)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ CURRENT PROBLEM

**Issue**: parserator.com redirects to "/lander" instead of main dashboard  
**Impact**: Users can't find the actual application  
**Root Cause**: Firebase hosting domain configuration needs updating

---

## ðŸ”§ SOLUTION STEPS

### **Step 1: Access Firebase Console**
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Sign in with your Google account (the one that owns parserator project)
3. Look for project named "parserator-production" or similar
4. Click on the project to enter

### **Step 2: Navigate to Hosting**
1. In left sidebar, click "Hosting"
2. You should see current deployments
3. Look for "parserator-production.web.app" domain

### **Step 3: Add Custom Domain**
1. Click "Add custom domain" button
2. Enter domain: `parserator.com`
3. Click "Continue"

### **Step 4: Verify Domain Ownership**
Firebase will show you DNS records to add:
1. **Copy the TXT record** they provide
2. **Go to your domain registrar** (where you bought parserator.com)
3. **Add the TXT record** to DNS settings
4. **Wait 5-10 minutes** for DNS propagation
5. **Return to Firebase** and click "Verify"

### **Step 5: SSL Certificate Setup**
1. Firebase will automatically provision SSL certificate
2. This may take 10-30 minutes
3. You'll see "Certificate provisioning" status

### **Step 6: Set as Primary Domain**
1. Once SSL is ready, you'll see option to "Set as primary domain"
2. Click this to make parserator.com the main URL
3. This redirects parserator-production.web.app â†’ parserator.com

## ðŸš¨ TROUBLESHOOTING

### **If Domain Won't Verify**
- Check DNS propagation: use dnschecker.org
- Ensure TXT record is exact match (no extra spaces)
- Wait longer - DNS can take up to 24 hours
- Contact domain registrar support if needed

### **If SSL Certificate Fails**
- Domain must be verified first
- Check that domain points to Firebase hosting
- Wait longer - SSL provisioning can take up to 1 hour
- Try removing and re-adding custom domain

### **If Still Redirects to "/lander"**
- Check Firebase hosting configuration
- Look for redirect rules in firebase.json
- Ensure index.html is the correct dashboard file
- Clear browser cache and try incognito mode

## ðŸ“± DOMAIN REGISTRAR ACCESS

**Where you bought parserator.com**:
- Check email for domain purchase confirmation
- Common registrars: GoDaddy, Namecheap, Google Domains, Cloudflare
- Look for "DNS Management" or "Name Servers" section
- You need to add TXT record for domain verification

**If you can't find registrar**:
- Use whois lookup: whois.net/parserator.com
- Check email for domain renewal notices
- Look at current nameservers to identify provider

---

## âš¡ QUICK SUCCESS PATH

**Total time: ~30 minutes**
1. **5 min**: Access Firebase console, navigate to hosting
2. **10 min**: Add custom domain, get verification records  
3. **10 min**: Add DNS records at domain registrar
4. **5 min**: Return to Firebase, verify and activate

**Result**: parserator.com loads dashboard correctly

---

## ðŸŽ¯ WHY THIS MATTERS

**Blocks marketing launch**: Can't send people to broken redirect  
**User experience**: Confusing when domain doesn't work  
**Professional credibility**: Broken domains look unprofessional  
**SEO impact**: Search engines can't index properly

**Once fixed**: Can immediately launch social media campaigns, blog posts, and community engagement pointing to parserator.com
