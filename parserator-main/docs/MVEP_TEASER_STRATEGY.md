## 📱 **Teaser Content Assets**

### **1. HyperAV Audio Demo Integration**
```html
<!-- Add to parserator.com -->
<section class="mvep-preview">
    <h2>🔮 Beyond Data Visualization</h2>
    <p>What if your data could be <em>experienced</em> in 4D?</p>
    
    <div class="audio-demo">
        <iframe src="/hyperav-demo.html" width="800" height="600"></iframe>
        <p class="caption">
            Live Audio → 4D Hypercube Projection<br>
            <small>This is just the beginning...</small>
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <button class="cta-teaser">Join the Waitlist</button>
</section>
```

### **2. Mysterious Screenshots Series**
- **Week 1**: JSON structure as swirling 4D lattice
- **Week 2**: Database schema as rotating hypercube
- **Week 3**: API logs as temporal 4D flows
- **Week 4**: "Your data has never looked like this..."

### **3. Technical Hints (No Full Reveals)**
```markdown
• "True 4-dimensional mathematics"
• "Six-axis hypercube rotation"  
• "Polytopal Projection Processing"
• "Data topology visualization"
• "RGB interference patterns"
```

### **4. Developer Intrigue Posts**
**Twitter/LinkedIn:**
```
🧮 What if you could see your JSON's *actual* dimensional complexity?

## 🎬 **Video Content Strategy**

### **Teaser Video 1: "The Audio Prototype"** (30 seconds)
- Show HyperAV responding to music
- Fade to text: "Audio is just the beginning..."
- End with: "parserator.com/mvep"

### **Teaser Video 2: "Data Has Dimensions"** (45 seconds)  
- Quick cuts of JSON → 4D transformations
- No UI shown, just pure visuals
- Voice over: "Your data lives in more dimensions than you see"

### **Teaser Video 3: "The Mathematics"** (60 seconds)
- Beautiful 4D rotation mathematics
- Shader code glimpses
- "Coming to the Parserator ecosystem"

## 📊 **Strategic Positioning Messages**

### **For Developers:**
```
"We cracked the visualization of high-dimensional data topology"
"4D hypercube mathematics made accessible"  
"Your JSON has geometry you've never seen"
```

### **For Data Scientists:**
```
"Topology-preserving dimensional projection"
"Pattern recognition through 4D exploration"
"Data structure complexity visualization"
```

### **For AI/ML Community:**
```
"Neural network geometry visualization"
"Agent decision space mapping"
"Multi-dimensional cognitive interfaces"
```

## 🔒 **Controlled Access Strategy**

### **HyperAV Demo as Proof-of-Concept**
