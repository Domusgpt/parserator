**Day 3 - Technical Deep Dive**
```
🔧 Why Agent Developers Choose Framework-Agnostic Parsing

Traditional parsing solutions lock you into specific frameworks:
❌ OpenAI Structured Outputs → GPT only
❌ LangChain OutputParsers → LangChain ecosystem only
❌ Custom solutions → Vendor dependency

✅ Parserator works universally:
• Google ADK integration
• MCP server compatibility  
• LangChain output parsers
• CrewAI tool integration
• AutoGPT plugin support

Never get locked into a single agent platform again.
