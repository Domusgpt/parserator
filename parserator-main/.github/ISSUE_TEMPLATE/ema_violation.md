## ‚ö†Ô∏è **EMA Violation Report**

This template is for reporting code, features, or behaviors that violate the core principles of Exoditical Moral Architecture. These issues are taken seriously as they undermine our foundational commitment to user liberation.

## üèõÔ∏è **EMA Principle Violated**

Select the principle(s) that are being violated:

### Digital Sovereignty
- [ ] User data ownership is unclear or violated
- [ ] Hidden data collection or processing
- [ ] Lack of user consent mechanisms
- [ ] Opaque data lineage or access controls

### Portability First
- [ ] Missing export functionality
- [ ] Artificial barriers to data extraction
- [ ] Proprietary formats without alternatives
- [ ] Lack of migration pathways

### Standards Agnostic
- [ ] Proprietary formats introduced without justification
- [ ] Vendor-specific dependencies without alternatives
- [ ] Framework lock-in mechanisms
- [ ] Closed protocols or interfaces

### Transparent Competition
- [ ] Blocking competitor integrations
- [ ] Hiding migration options from users
- [ ] Dishonest competitive comparisons
- [ ] Sabotaging interoperability

## üìç **Location of Violation**

**File/Module:** 
**Function/Class:** 
**Line Numbers:** 

**Code Snippet:**
```javascript
// Paste the problematic code here
```

## üîç **Detailed Description**

Explain specifically how this code or feature violates EMA principles:

### What's Wrong?
Clear description of the violation and why it's problematic.

### User Impact
How does this affect user sovereignty and freedom?

### Current Behavior
What happens now that violates EMA principles?

### Expected EMA-Compliant Behavior
What should happen instead to align with EMA principles?

## üìã **Evidence**

### User Experience Impact
- [ ] Users cannot export their data
- [ ] Users cannot migrate to competitors
- [ ] Users are unaware of their options
- [ ] Users are being tracked without consent
- [ ] Users cannot control their data

### Technical Evidence
Include screenshots, API responses, or other evidence:

**Example Request/Response:**
```json
{
  "request": "...",
  "response": "...",
  "issue": "No export option provided"
}
```

## üîß **Proposed Fix**

### Immediate Actions
What can be done right now to address this violation?

### Long-term Solution
What architectural changes are needed for full EMA compliance?

### Alternative Approaches
Are there multiple ways to fix this while maintaining functionality?

## üìä **Impact Assessment**

### Severity Level
- [ ] Critical - Completely violates core EMA principle
- [ ] High - Significant violation with major user impact
- [ ] Medium - Partial violation that needs addressing
- [ ] Low - Minor deviation from best practices

### User Scope
- [ ] Affects all users
- [ ] Affects specific user types
- [ ] Affects specific use cases
- [ ] Limited impact scope

### Business Impact
- [ ] Undermines EMA brand positioning
- [ ] Creates legal/compliance risks
- [ ] Damages user trust
- [ ] Competitive disadvantage

## üéØ **EMA Compliance Roadmap**
