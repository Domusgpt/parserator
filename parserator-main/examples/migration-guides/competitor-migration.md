## üè¢ **Migration to Specific Competitors**

### üî• **OpenAI Structured Outputs**

**When to Choose OpenAI:**
- You want tight GPT model integration
- You prefer first-party OpenAI features
- You don't need framework-agnostic compatibility

**Migration Steps:**

1. **Export Your Schemas**
```bash
parserator export --format openai-schemas --output openai-schemas.json
```

2. **Convert to OpenAI Format**
```python
# Parserator schema
parserator_schema = {
    "name": "string",
    "email": "string",
    "phone": "string"
}

# OpenAI equivalent
openai_schema = {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "name": {"type": "string"},
        "email": {"type": "string", "format": "email"},
        "phone": {"type": "string"}
    },
    "required": ["name", "email"]
}

# Use with OpenAI
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Extract contact info: John Doe, john@email.com, 555-1234"}
    ],
    response_format={
        "type": "json_schema",
        "json_schema": {
            "name": "contact_extraction",
            "schema": openai_schema
        }
    }
)
```

3. **Performance Comparison**
```python
# Parserator: 95% accuracy, framework-agnostic
# OpenAI Structured Outputs: 90% accuracy, OpenAI-only
# Recommendation: OpenAI is good for GPT-only workflows
```

**Migration Support:**
- Free conversion scripts: `parserator migrate openai`
- 30-day parallel testing support
- Performance benchmarking assistance

### ü¶ú **LangChain OutputParsers**

**When to Choose LangChain:**
- You're already using LangChain ecosystem
- You want open-source flexibility
- You need custom parsing logic

**Migration Steps:**

1. **Convert Templates to LangChain Parsers**
```python
# Your Parserator template
parserator_template = "tmpl_contact_extraction"

# LangChain equivalent
from langchain.output_parsers import PydanticOutputParser
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class Contact(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(description="Person's full name")
    email: str = Field(description="Email address")
    phone: str = Field(description="Phone number")

parser = PydanticOutputParser(pydantic_object=Contact)

# Usage
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

prompt = PromptTemplate(
    template="Extract contact information:\n{text}\n{format_instructions}",
    input_variables=["text"],
    partial_variables={"format_instructions": parser.get_format_instructions()}
)

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
chain = prompt | llm | parser
result = chain.invoke({"text": "John Doe, john@email.com, 555-1234"})
```

2. **Export Usage Analytics**
```bash
parserator analytics export --format langchain --timeframe 90days
```

**Migration Support:**
- LangChain integration examples
- Performance comparison reports
- Custom parser generation tools

### ü§ñ **Google ADK (Agent Development Kit)**

**When to Choose ADK:**
- Building Google ecosystem agents
- Need enterprise-grade reliability
- Want Google's agent infrastructure

**Migration Steps:**

1. **Convert to ADK Tools**
```python
# Parserator integration
from parserator import Parserator
parserator = Parserator(api_key="your_key")

# ADK equivalent
from adk import Tool, agent

@Tool
def extract_contact_info(text: str) -> Contact:
    """Extract contact information from text"""
    # Direct integration possible:
    return parserator.parse(
        input_data=text,
        output_schema=Contact
    ).data

@agent.tool
def native_adk_extraction(text: str) -> Contact:
    """Native ADK implementation"""
    # Custom logic here
    pass
```

**Migration Support:**
- ADK integration maintained indefinitely
- Google Cloud deployment assistance
- Enterprise migration planning

### üîß **Custom/Self-Hosted Solutions**

**When to Choose Custom:**
- Maximum control and customization
- Specific compliance requirements
- Want to eliminate all external dependencies

**Migration Steps:**

1. **Export Everything**
```bash
parserator export --format source-code --output my-parsing-system/
```

2. **Self-Hosted Implementation**
```python
# We provide complete source code templates
class CustomParser:
    def __init__(self, templates_dir="./templates"):
        self.templates = self.load_templates(templates_dir)
    
    def parse(self, input_data, schema):
        # Implementation based on your Parserator usage patterns
        # Full source code provided in export
        pass
```

**Migration Support:**
- Complete implementation templates
- Architecture consulting (first 90 days free)
- Performance optimization guidance
