## Exoditical Moral Architecture (EMA) Compliance

This software is certified EMA-compliant, meaning it adheres to the four core
principles of liberation-focused software development:

1. **Digital Sovereignty**: Your data belongs to you, not us
2. **Portability First**: Export everything, migrate anywhere
3. **Standards Agnostic**: Universal compatibility, zero lock-in
4. **Transparent Competition**: We help you leave if you need to

### EMA License Addendum

In addition to the standard MIT License terms above, this software includes
the following EMA-specific commitments:

**Data Liberation Guarantee**: Users have the absolute right to export all
their data in portable, standard formats at any time, without restriction,
charge, or artificial delay.

**Migration Assistance Commitment**: We pledge to provide reasonable assistance
to users who wish to migrate their data and workflows to competing platforms,
including documentation, tools, and technical support.

**Standards Compliance**: This software uses open standards and protocols
wherever possible, and any proprietary formats include clear migration paths
to open alternatives.

**Competitive Transparency**: We maintain honest, public documentation about
our capabilities relative to competitors, including clear guidance on when
alternative solutions might better serve user needs.

**Right to Leave**: The ultimate expression of empowerment is the freedom to
leave. This software is designed to make departure as elegant and complete as
arrival.
