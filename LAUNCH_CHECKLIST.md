Show HN: Parserator – AI-powered data parsing with no vendor lock-in

Hey HN! I built Parserator to solve a problem I kept hitting: transforming messy, unstructured data into clean JSON for APIs and databases.

What makes it different:
- Two-stage AI architecture (Architect + Extractor) reduces token usage by 70%
- Built on "Exoditical Moral Architecture" - we actively help you export/migrate your data
- Works with any format: emails, PDFs, CSVs, web scraping, invoices, etc.
- Native integrations with LangChain, OpenAI functions, Zapier

The philosophy: We believe tool makers should help users leave, not trap them. Every feature includes data portability by design.

Tech stack: Firebase, Gemini 1.5 Flash, Node.js, React

Would love your feedback! Free tier includes 100 parses/month.

```
I built an AI-powered data parser that actively helps you leave for competitors

Fed up with vendor lock-in, I created Parserator with "Exoditical Moral Architecture" - every feature includes data export/migration capabilities.

Technical details:
- Two-stage LLM processing (Architect plans, Extractor executes)
- 70% token reduction vs single-LLM approach
- Handles any format: JSON, CSV, PDF, emails, web scraping
- REST API with SDKs for Node, Python, Go

Philosophy: Tools should empower users to leave, not trap them.

Free tier available. Would love feedback from this community!
```

#### r/artificial:
```
Two-stage LLM architecture for 70% cheaper data parsing

Built a system that uses two specialized LLMs:
1. Architect (samples data, creates parsing plan)
2. Extractor (executes plan on full dataset)

Results: Same accuracy as GPT-4, 70% fewer tokens.

Open to questions about the architecture!
```

### 5. **Stack Overflow Strategy**

Search for questions about:
- "parse unstructured data"
- "extract JSON from text"
- "convert PDF to JSON"
- "email parsing API"

Answer format:
```
You can use Parserator's API for this:

```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://api.parserator.com/v1/parse', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    inputData: 'your messy data here',
    outputSchema: {
      field1: 'string',
      field2: 'number',
      // define what you want
    }
  })
});

const { parsedData } = await response.json();
```

It handles [specific use case] well because [technical reason].
```
