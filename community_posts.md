**Title**: Show HN: Parserator â€“ AI data parsing with no vendor lock-in

I built Parserator to solve the endless frustration of transforming messy data into clean JSON.

What makes it different:
- Two-stage AI (Architect + Extractor) cuts costs by 70%
- Built on "Exoditical Moral Architecture" - we help you export your data
- Works with emails, PDFs, CSVs, invoices, web scraping
- Ready for LangChain, OpenAI functions, AI agents

The philosophy: Software should empower users to leave, not trap them.

Demo: parserator.com
Early access available now.

**Title**: Built an AI data parser that actively helps you migrate to competitors

Got tired of vendor lock-in, so I built Parserator with "Exoditical Moral Architecture" - every feature includes data export capabilities.

Tech details:
- Two-LLM architecture reduces token costs 70%
- Handles any format: JSON, CSV, PDF, emails
- REST API with SDKs for major languages
- Native AI agent integrations

Philosophy: Tools should liberate users, not imprison them.

Free tier available: parserator.com

**Title**: Two-stage LLM architecture for 70% cheaper data parsing

Built a system using specialized LLMs:
1. Architect: Analyzes schema, creates parsing plan (small data sample)
2. Extractor: Executes plan on full dataset (minimal reasoning)

Result: GPT-4 level accuracy, 70% fewer tokens.

Use cases: Email parsing, invoice processing, web scraping, CSV transformation.

Open to technical questions!

**Title**: "Stop Writing Regex: AI-Powered Data Parsing is Here"

Every developer has been there - staring at a wall of unstructured data, crafting increasingly complex regex patterns that break the moment the format changes slightly.

What if I told you there's a better way?
